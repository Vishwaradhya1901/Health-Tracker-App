Health Tracker Website

We developed a user-friendly health tracker website that allows users to conveniently monitor and store their daily health metrics. The website features:

Water Intake: Users can log their daily water consumption to ensure they stay hydrated.
Exercise Duration: A dedicated section to input and track the duration of physical activities.
Blood Sugar Levels: Users can record their blood sugar readings to monitor and manage their health effectively.
The data is stored locally, providing an easy-to-access history of health metrics, which is displayed in an organized table format.
